## Introduction

The CCDB Application's architecture is constructed to facilitate efficient data collection, processing, and storage. Aimed at seamless integration with cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain nodes, it ensures high availability and fault tolerance while catering to the demands of scalability and security.

## Exchange Data Collectors

Exchange Data Collectors are specialized components that interface with cryptocurrency exchange APIs to fetch market data. This part of the document would cover their design and how they ensure data consistency and reliability.
