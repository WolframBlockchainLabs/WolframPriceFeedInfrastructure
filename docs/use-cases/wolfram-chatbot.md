# **Use Case: Wolfram ChatBot Insights**

## Overview

This use case describes a ChatGPT plugin designed to interface with a TimescaleDB database using natural language processing. The plugin enables users to query and interact with the data through conversational input. Below, we evaluate a proposed method for integrating this plugin with our project's infrastructure.

## Introduction

The Wolfram ChatGPT plugin is tasked with providing an intuitive and natural interface for querying a TimescaleDB database, allowing users to interact with data without the need for structured query language knowledge.

## Plugin Capabilities

-   **Natural Language Queries**: Users can ask questions or make requests using natural language.
-   **Data Retrieval**: The plugin scans the database, retrieving information as per the user's request.
-   **Interactive Responses**: Provides conversational feedback based on the data retrieved from the database.

## Private Network Exposure

### Proposal

-   Expose the TimescaleDB port within a private network.
-   Create a read-only user for specific tables.
-   Enforce query execution time limits.

### Benefits

-   Simplified database setup.
-   Enhanced security within a controlled environment.

### Trade-offs

-   Limited management capabilities.
-   Complexity in setting up and maintaining a private network.
-   Manual security management may increase the risk of breaches.
-   TLS setup for database connections may be error-prone.
