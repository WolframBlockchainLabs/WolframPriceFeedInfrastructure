# How to Add Markets to XRPL Configurations

This document provides instructions for community members who wish to contribute by adding new market pairs to the XRPL configurations.

## Adding New Market Pairs

To add a new market pair to the `xrpl-collectors.config.json`, follow the steps below:

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Fork the repository to create a personal copy where you can make changes.

2. **Open the Configuration File**  
   Within your fork, navigate to the `configs/xrpl` directory and open the `xrpl-collectors.config.json` file.

3. **Add a New Market Pair**  
   To add a new market pair, include an entry in the `markets` array using the following structure:

    ```json
    {
        "pair": {
            "in": {
                "symbol": "BASE_CURRENCY",
                "meta": {
                    "currency": "BASE_CURRENCY"
                }
            },
            "out": {
                "symbol": "COUNTER_CURRENCY",
                "meta": {
                    "currency": "COUNTER_CURRENCY",
                    "issuer": "ISSUER_ADDRESS"
                }
            }
        },
        "symbol": "BASE_CURRENCY/ISSUER_ADDRESS:COUNTER_CURRENCY"
    }
    ```

    Replace `BASE_CURRENCY`, `COUNTER_CURRENCY`, and `ISSUER_ADDRESS` with the appropriate values for your market pair. The `issuer` is required for every token except for the native XRP.

4. **Example Market Pair**  
   Here is an example of how to add a market pair for a token (e.g., XRP) against USD:

    ```json
    {
        "pair": {
            "in": {
                "symbol": "XRP",
                "meta": {
                    "currency": "XRP"
                }
            },
            "out": {
                "symbol": "USD",
                "meta": {
                    "currency": "USD",
                    "issuer": "rhub8VRN55s94qWKDv6jmDy1pUykJzF3wq"
                }
            }
        },
        "symbol": "XRP/GateHub:USD"
    }
    ```

    Ensure to add your new entry alongside the existing market pairs within the `markets` array.

5. **Commit and Push Changes**  
   After adding your new market pair, commit your changes with a meaningful message such as "feat: add XRP/USD market pair to XRPL config".

6. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   Push your changes to your fork and create a pull request to the original repository. Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers.

## Guidelines for Contributions

-   Follow the JSON structure provided in the examples.
-   Ensure that the `issuer` field is included for all tokens, with the exception of the native XRP token.
-   Verify the accuracy of the `issuer` address and the currency codes.
-   Provide a clear and descriptive commit message for your changes.
